    <section class=" bio ">
      <p> I hold the greatest admiration for my younger self, back when I hadn't yet reached the age of 'sweet sixteen', way before the adulthood. I experienced a sense of freedom that allowed me to think without the fear of judgment,to  schedule a day filled with creativity and passion, to think about the future  with optimism, believing it would  fairly grant me the opportunity to pursue my dreams.These thoughts and wants were far away from the demanding and often harsh realities. Dreams come true through unwavering passion and hard work toward a singular goal. Was that sufficient? I find myself pondering.</p>
       <p> In an era where becoming a master of some is more valued than being a master of one, She was never driven by greed and consistently displayed generosity.She never had any materialistic desires for herself, embodying the true essence of a human being navigating the life of ups and downs with resilience and courage, thriving through it, unafraid to embrace each moment as it came. I deeply admire how my younger self handled challenging moments and prioritized her own happiness because she recognized her worth. She felt every emotion fully and held her head high even if she was pretending.</p>

<p>Perhaps she held high expectations for me, but that wasn't a fault. She was a child, and I am now an adult, both of us oblivious, unaware to 'the changes', that wise people often refer to as life."</p>
